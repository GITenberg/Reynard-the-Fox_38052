<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>I have been asked to write why I wrote this poem of "Reynard
the Fox." As a man grows older, life becomes more interesting
but less easy to know; for, late in life, even the strongest yields
to the habit of his compartment. When he cannot range through
all society, from the court to the gutter, a man must go where
all society meets, as at the Pilgrimage, the Festival or the Game.
Here in England the Game is both a festival and an occasion of
pilgrimage. A man wanting to set down a picture of the society
of England will find his models at the games.</p>

<p>What are the English games? The man's game is Association
football; the woman's game, perhaps, hockey or lacrosse. Golf
I regard more as a symptom of a happy marriage than a game.
Cricket, which was once widely popular among both sexes has lost
its hold, except among the young. The worst of all these games
is that few can play them at a time.</p>

<p>But in the English country, during the autumn, winter and
early spring of each year, the main sport is fox hunting, which
is not like cricket or football, a game for a few and a spectacle
for many, but something in which all who come may take a part,
whether rich or poor, mounted or on foot. It is a sport loved and
followed by both sexes, all ages and all classes. At a fox hunt,
and nowhere else in England, except perhaps at a funeral, can
you see the whole of the land's society brought together, focussed
for the observer, as the Canterbury pilgrims were for Chaucer.</p>

<p>This fact made the subject attractive. The fox hunt gave an
opportunity for a picture or pictures of the members of an English
community.</p>

<p>Then to all Englishmen who have lived in a hunting country,
hunting is in the blood, and the mind is full of it. It is the most
beautiful and the most stirring sight to be seen in England. In
the ports, as at Falmouth, there are ships under sail, under way,
coming or going, beautiful unspeakably. In the country, especially
on the great fields on the lower slopes of the Downland, the
teams of the ploughmen may be seen bowing forward on a sky-line,
and this sight can never fail to move one by its majesty of
beauty. But in neither of these sights of beauty is there the
bright colour and swift excitement of the hunt, nor the thrill of
the horn, and the cry of the hounds ringing into the elements of
the soul. Something in the hunt wakens memories hidden in the
marrow, racial memories, of when one hunted for the tribe, animal
memories, perhaps, of when one hunted with the pack, or was
hunted.</p>

<p>Hunting has always been popular here in England. In ancient
times it was necessary. Wolves, wild boar, foxes and deer had
to be kept down. To hunt was then the social duty of the mounted
man, when he was not engaged in war. It was also the opportunity
of all other members of the community to have a good time in
the open, with a feast or a new fur at the end, to crown the
pleasure.</p>

<p>Since arms of precision were made, hunting on horseback with
hounds has perhaps been unnecessary everywhere, but it is not
easy to end a pleasure rooted in the instincts of men. Hunting
has continued, and probably will continue, in this country and
in Ireland. It is rapidly becoming a national sport in the United
States.</p>

<p>Some have written, that hunting is the sport of the wealthy
man. Some wealthy men hunt, no doubt, but they are not the
backbone of the sport, so much as those who love and use horses.
Parts of this country, of Ireland and of the United States are more
than ordinarily good pasture, fitted for the breeding of horses,
beyond most other places in the world. Hardly anywhere else
is the climate so equable, the soil so right for the feet of colts and
the grass so good. Where these conditions exist, men will breed
horses and use them. Men who breed good horses will ride,
jump and test them, and will invent means of riding, jumping
and testing them, the steeplechase, the circus, the contests at
fairs and shows, the point-to-point meeting, and they will preserve,
if possible, any otherwise dying sport which offers such means.</p>

<p>I have mentioned several reasons why fox hunting should be
popular: (<i>a</i>) that it is a social business, at which the whole community
may and does attend in vast numbers in a pleasant mood of
goodwill, good humour and equality, and during which all may
go anywhere, into ground otherwise shut to them; (<i>b</i>) that it is
done in the winter, at a season when other social gatherings are
difficult, and in country districts where no buildings, except the
churches, could contain the numbers assembled; (<i>c</i>) that it is
most beautiful to watch, so beautiful that perhaps very few of
the acts of men can be so lovely to watch nor so exhilarating.
The only thing to be compared with it, in this country, is the
sword dance, the old heroical dancing of the young men, still
practised, in all its splendour of wild beauty, in some country places;
(<i>d</i>) that we are a horse-loving people who have loved horses as
we have loved the sea, and have made, in the course of generations,
a breed of horse, second to none in the world, for beauty
and speed.</p>

<p>But besides all these reasons, there is another that brings many
out hunting. This is the delight in hunting, in the working of
hounds, by themselves, or with the huntsmen, to find and kill
their fox. Though many men and women hunt in order to ride,
many still ride in order to hunt.</p>

<p>Perhaps this delight in hunting was more general in the mid-eighteenth
century, when hounds were much slower than at
present. Then, the hunt was indeed a test of hounds and huntsman.
The fox was not run down but hunted down. The great
run then was that in which hounds and huntsman kept to their
fox. The great run now is perhaps that in which some few riders
keep with the hounds.</p>

<p>The ideal run of 1750 might have been described thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Being in the current of Writing, I cannot but acquaint your
Lorp of ye great Hunt there was, this Tuesday last there was a
a Week. Sure so great a day has not been seen here since The
Day your Lorp's Father broke his Collar Bone at ye Park Wall.
As Milton says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well have we speeded, and o'er Hill and Dale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forest and Field and Flood ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As far as Indus east, Euphrates west."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"We had but dismle Weather of it, and so cold, as made Sir
Harry observe, that it was an ill wind blew no-one any good.
We met at ye Tailings. I had out my brown Horse. There was
present Sir Anthony Smoaker; Mr. Jarvis of Copse Stile; William
Travis; John Hawbuck; your Lorp's Friend, Dick Fancowe, and
two of ye Red Coats from ye Barracks. Ye fair Sex was dismayed,
it was said, by ye rudeness of ye Elements; they did not
venture it.</p>

<p>"On coming to draw Tailings Wood, Glider spoke to it, and
Tom viewed him away for the Valley, being the old Dog Fox,
with the white Mask, that beat us at Fubb's Field, the day your
Lorp road Bluebell.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now spoke the chearful Horn; and tuneful Hounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed, and Red Coats gallopped; stirring Scean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rude Health and Manly Wit together strive.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"We went with the extream of Violence from Tailings Wood
to ye small Coppice at Nap Hill where a Fellow put him from his
Point, which gave Occasion to Sir Anthony to correct him. Ye
little magpie Hound made it out in ye bog at ye back of ye Coppice,
when again Hounds went at head through Long Stone Pastures
as far as Tainton. Here we was delayed in ye Dear Park,
the effluvia of ye Dear being extream strong and doubtless puzzling
to the Noses of ye Hounds. And here I cannot but remark the
skill with which ye Hounds worked it out till they had hit it
off, a sight, as Mr. Jarvis remarked to me, worthy of the Admiration
of an antient Philosopher, and of the eloquence of a most
elegant Wit, or Poet. Leaving ye Dear Park, He made for Norton
Cross, which he left on his left Hand, as though deciding for ye
Hill. Crossing ye Hill, in Spite of ye Sheep, he was a little staggered
by his being run by one of ye Shepherd's Doggs, a part of
Creation that should not be tolerated, except in ye vision of ye
Poet, as in a Pastoral or so. Here Joe Phillips, our Huntsman,
made unavailing Casts, but by lifting to the Vineyard recovered
him, when Hounds run him to Cow's Crookham, on your Lorp's
Aston Estate.</p>

<p>"By this Time, your Lorp will understand our Distress. Dick
Fancowe was in ye Brook at Norton, Mr. Jarvis' grey Horse had
cast a Shoe, and one of ye Red Coats had broak his Liver in falling
at a Fence. For a time we went about to recover him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now with attentive Nose the restless Hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endeavours on the Scent, now here, now there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning adulterat scents of lesser Prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now gloomy care invades the Huntsman's Face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sportsmen (jovial erst) on weary steeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sit pensive."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here might well be seen the Advantages of a judicious Breeding in
Hounds, that neglects not the intellectual Part, but aims rather
at a complete Animal than alone at Sinews and Corporeal Structure.
That Blood of the Old Berkshire Glorious, which your
Lorp's Father was wont to observe, was what he most stood by,
next to our Constitution and the Protestant Succession, here
stood us in good stead, for it was to Glorious ye Ninth, as well
as to Growler and Glider (all of ye same royal strain) that we
was indebted to ye happy Conclusion. They pushed him out of
ye Stubbings at Cow's Crookham, where it seems he had taken
Refuge in the Hollow of a decayed Tree. We chac't him thence
upon ye Grass to Shepherd's Hey. Here he began to run short,
being not a little apprehensive, lest his Foes should triumph, and
snatch from him that Life, which he had so long nefariously
pampered.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On courtly Cock with all his household Train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hens obsequious, by the Hen Wife mourned.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Sun, coming out from among ye Clouds, where he had been
too long hid, made (as was elegantly pretended by Sir Anthony), a
Brightness, animating indeed to us, who carried the Sword of
Justice, but, to the Criminal of our Pursuit, infinitely distressing.
Then had your Lorp seen the gay Ardor of the Pack, as they came
to the View, which they did about Stonepits, your Lorp would
have said with the late elegant Poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now o'er the glittering grass the sinewy Hound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes from his Feet the Dew and makes ye Woods resound."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To be brief, we killed in the Back Yard of ye Rummer and Glass
after two and three quarters Hours of a Hunt such as (all are
agreed) is not lightly to be parallelled. There was present at
ye Death, beside Joe Phillips and Tom, Sir A. Smoaker, Mr. Wm. Travis
and myself, all so extream distresst, Men and Beasts, that
it was observed, it was a Marvel ye Horses were not dead. Such
an Hunt, it was agreed, should be celebrated by an annual Dinner,
at which the Toast of ye Chase might be rendered more than
ordinary. Ye Hunt was upwards of Fifteen Miles in Length, and
hath been the Subject of a Song, by a Member of Ye Hunt,
which, as it would take long to transcribe, I forbear, hoping that
we may sing it to your Lorp before (as ye Poet says)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Ye vixen hath laid up her Cubs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In snuggest Cave secure, when balmy Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wakens ye Meadows."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But to pass now from Celestial Pleasures to Worldly Cares, I
have to acquaint your Lorp that your Lorp's Sister's Son, Mr.
Parracombe, hath been killed by a Fall from his Horse, after
Dinner with some Gentlemen, his particular Friends, an Affliction
indeed great, humanly regarded, were it not also considered, how
much happier his Lot must be, than in this Vale of Tears, etc.
Ye Young Hounds thrive apace, and it is thought the forward
Season will be very favourable for their future Prey. I am, your
Lorp's most obedient, Charles Cothill."</p>

<p>Perhaps the ideal run of the present time would be described
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A large field attended the Templecombe on Tuesday last at
the popular meet at Heydigates. Will Mynors, late of the Parratts,
carried the horn, in place of Tom Carling, now with
Mr. Fletchers. A little time was spent in running through the
shrubberies in the garden at Heydigates and then the word was
given for the Cantlows. Will had no sooner put hounds into
this famous cover than the dog pack proclaimed the joyous news.
The fox, a traveller, was at once viewed away for the Three Oaks,
across the rather heavy going of the pasture land. Coming to
the Knock Brook, he swam it near Parson's Pleasure, going at
a pace that let the knowing ones know that they were in for something
out of the common. Keeping Snib's Farm on his right, he
ran dead straight for Gallow's Wood, where some woodmen with
their teams disturbed him. Swinging to his left, he went up the
hill, through Bloody Lane, as though towards Dinsmore, but was
again deflected by woodmen. Turning down the hill, he ran
for the valley, passing Enderton Schoolhouse, the scholars of
which were much cheered by the near prospect of the hunt. It
was now evident that he was going for the Downs. Some of
the less daring began to express the hope that he might be headed.</p>

<p>"Scent from the first was burning and the pace a cracker.
After leaving Enderton he made straight for the Danesway, past
Snub's Titch and the Curlews, the green meadows of the pasture
being sprinkled for miles with the relics of the field. He crossed
the Roman Road at Orm's Oak and at once entered the Danesway,
going at a pace which all thought could not last.</p>

<p>"At the summit of the Danesway, known as the Gallows Point,
hounds were brought to their noses, owing to the crossing of the
line by sheep. A man working nearby was able to give the line
and Will, lifting beyond the Lynchets, at once hit him off, and
the hounds resumed their rush. From this point, they went almost
exactly straight from the head of the Danesway to the fir copse
by Arthur's Table. All this part of the run being across a rolling
grass land, was at top speed, such as no horse could live with.
At Arthur's Table, he was put from his earth by shooters who
were netting the warren. As he could not get through them nor
across the highway, then busy with traffic, He doubled down across
the Starvings, where Will, the only man up at this point, although
now three hundred yards behind hounds, caught sight of him on
the opposite slope, romping away from hounds as though he would
never grow old. On coming to the level, past Spinney's End,
some of those who had been left at the Lynchets were able to
rejoin, but were soon again cast out by the extreme violence of
the going, which continued back across the Downs on a line obliquely
parallel with his former track though a mile further to the
south. It was supposed that he was going for the main earth
in Bloody Acre Copse. Some workers in the strip at the edge of
the copse headed him from this point. He swung left-handed past
Staves acre, and so down to the valley by the shelving ground
near Monk's Charwell. Here, for some unaccountable reason,
the scent, which had been breast high, became catchy, and hounds
lost their fox in the Osier cars at Charwell Springs. Later in the
afternoon, while jogging home, a second fox was chopped in Mr.
Parsloe's cover at Prince's Charwell. Hounds then went home.</p>

<p>"The run from the Cantlows was not remarkable for any quality
of hunting, but extremely so for pace and length. The distance
run, from Cantlows Wood to the Osiers cannot have been less than
thirteen miles, most of it indeed on the best going in the world,
but at a racing pace, with nothing that can be called a check,
the whole way. Some wished that the hounds might have been
rewarded and others that Will Mynors might have crowned his
opening gallop with a kill, but the general feeling was one of
satisfaction that so game a fox escaped."</p>

<p>My own interest in fox hunting began at a very early age.
I was born in a good hunting country, partly woodland, partly
pasture. My home, during my first seven years, was within
half a mile of the kennels. I saw hounds on most days of my life.
Hounds and hunting filled my imagination. I saw many meets,
each as romantic as a circus. The huntsman and whipper-in
seemed, then, to be the greatest men in the world, and those
mild slaves, the hounds, the loveliest animals.</p>

<p>Often, as a little child, I saw and heard hounds hunting in and
near a covert within sight of my old home. Once, when I was,
perhaps, five years old, the fox was hunted into our garden, and
those glorious beings in scarlet, as well as the hounds, were all
about my lairs, like visitants from Paradise. The fox, on this
occasion, went through a woodshed and escaped.</p>

<p>Later in my childhood, though I lived less near to the kennels,
I was still within a mile of them, and saw hounds frequently at
all seasons. In that hunting country, hunting was one of the
interests of life; everybody knew about it, loved, followed,
watched and discussed it. I went to many meets, and followed
many hunts on foot. Each of these occasions is now distinct in
my mind, with the colour and intensity of beauty. I saw many
foxes starting off upon their runs, with the hounds close behind
them. It was then that I learned to admire the ease and beauty
of the speed of the fresh fox. That leisurely hurry, which romps
away from the hardest trained and swiftest fox hounds without a
visible effort, as though the hounds were weighted with lead,
is the most lovely motion I have seen in an animal.</p>

<p>No fox was the original of my Reynard, but as I was much in
the woods as a boy I saw foxes fairly often, considering that they
are night-moving animals. Their grace, beauty, cleverness, and
secrecy always thrilled me. Then that kind of grin which the
mask wears made me credit them with an almost human humour.
I thought the fox a merry devil, though a bloody one. Then he
is one against many, who keeps his end up, and lives, often snugly,
in spite of the world. The pirate and the nightrider are nothing
to the fox, for romance and danger. This way of life of his makes
it difficult to observe him in a free state at close quarters.</p>

<p>Once in the early spring in the very early morning, I saw a
vixen playing with her cubs in the open space below a beech tree.
Once I came upon a big dog-fox in a wheel-wright's yard, and
watched him from within a few paces for some minutes. Twice
I have watched half-grown cubs stalking rabbits. Twice out hunting,
the fox has broken cover within three yards of me. These are
the only free foxes which I have seen at close quarters. Foxes
are night-moving animals. To know them well one should have
cat's eyes and foxes' habits. By the imagination alone can men
know foxes.</p>

<p>When I was about halfway through my poem, I found a dead
dog-fox in a field near Cumnor Hurst. He was a fine full-grown
fox in perfect condition; he must have picked up poison, for he
had not been hunted, nor shot. On the pads of this dead fox, I
noticed for the first time, the length and strength of a fox's claws.</p>

<p>Some have asked, whether the Ghost Heath Run is founded on
any recorded run of any real Hunt. It is not. It is an imaginary
run, in a country made up of many different pieces of country,
some of them real, some of them imaginary. These real and
imaginary fields, woods and brooks are taken as they exist, from
Berkshire, where the fox lives, from Herefordshire where he was
found, from Trapalanda, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire, Herefordshire,
Worcestershire and Berkshire, where he ran, from Trapalanda,
where he nearly died, and from a wild and beautiful
corner in Berkshire where he rests from his run.</p>

<p>Some have asked when the poem was written. It was written
between January 1 and May 20, 1919.</p>

<p>Some have asked, whether hunting will soon be abolished.
I cannot tell, but I think it unlikely. People do not willingly
resign their pleasures; men who breed horses will want to gallop
them across country; hunting is a pleasure, as well as an opportunity
to gallop; it is also an instinct in man. Some have thought
that if "small holdings," that is "produce gardens," intensively
cultivated, of about an acre apiece, became common, so that the
country became more rigidly enclosed than at present, hunting
would be made almost impossible. The small holding is generally
the property of the small farmer (like the French cultivateur) who
fences permanently with wire and cannot take down the wire
during the hunting season, as most English farmers do at present.
Small holdings will probably increase in number near towns, but
farmers seem agreed that they can never become the national
system of farming. The big farm, that can treat the great tract
with machines, seems likely to be the farm of the future.</p>

<p>Even if the small holdings system were to prevail, it would
hardly prevail over the sporting instincts of the race. Beauty
and delight are stronger than the will to work. I am pretty sure
that a pack of hounds, coming feathery by, at the heels of a whip's
horse, while the field takes station and the huntsman, drawing
his horn, prepares to hunt, would shake the resolve of most small
holders, digging in their lots with thrift, industry and self-control.
And then, if the huntsman were to blow his horn, and the hounds
to feather on it and give tongue, and find, and go away at head,
I am pretty sure that most of the small holders of this race would
follow them. It is in this race to hunt.</p>

<p>I will conclude with a portrait of old Baldy Hill, the earth-stopper,
who in the darkness of the early morning gads about on
a pony, to "stop" or "put to" all earths, in which a hard-pressed
fox might hide. In the poem, he enters when the hunt is about
to start, but he is an important figure in a hunting community,
and deserves a portrait. He may come here, at the beginning,
for Baldy Hill is at the beginning of all fox hunts. He dates from
the beginning of Man. I have seen many a Baldy Hill in my life;
he never fails to give me the feeling that he is Primitive Man
survived. Primitive Man lived like that, in the woods, in the
darkness, outwitting the wild things, while the rain dripped, and
the owl cried, and the ghost came out from the grave. Baldy
Hill stole the last litter of the last she-wolf to cross them with the
King's hounds. He was in at the death of the last wild-boar.
Sometimes, in looking at him, I think that his ashen stake must
have a flint head, with which, on moony nights, he still creeps
out, to rouse, it may be, the mammoth in his secret valley, or
a sabretooth tiger, still caved in the woods. Life may and does
shoot out into exotic forms, which may and do flower and perish.
Perhaps when all the other forms of English life are gone, the
Baldy Hill form, the stock form, will abide, still striding, head
bent, with an ashen stake, after some wild thing, that has meat,
or fur, or is difficult or dangerous to tackle.</p>

<span class="i0">Old Baldy Hill, the game old cock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still wore knee-gaiters and a smock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bore a five foot ashen stick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All scarred and pilled from many a click<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beating in covert with his sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive the pheasants to the guns.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">His face was beaten by the weather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wrinkled red like bellows leather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a cold clear hard blue eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His snares made many a rabbit die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On moony nights he found it pleasant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stare the woods for roosting pheasant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up near the tree-trunk on the bough.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">He never trod behind a plough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He and his two sons got their food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From wild things in the field and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By snares, by ferrets put in holes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By ridding pasture-land of moles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By keeping, beating, trapping, poaching<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spaniel-and-retriever-coaching.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza"><br />
<span class="i0">He and his sons had special merits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In breeding and in handling ferrets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full many a snaky hob and jill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bit the thumbs of Baldy Hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no beard, but long white hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bent in gait. He used to wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowers in his smock, gold-clocks and peasen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spindle-fruit in hunting season.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I hope that he may live to wear spindle-fruit for many seasons
to come. Hunting makes more people happy than anything I
know. When people are happy together, I am quite certain
that they build up something eternal, something both beautiful
and divine, which weakens the power of all evil things upon this
life of men and women.</p>

<span class="i0">Long since the haunt of Benjamin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To fill that quiet width of road<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A woodland day was what they feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(As second horsemen), shaving there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, in the stalls where hunters were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straw rustled as the horses shifted,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From racks as horses tugged their feed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow gulping sounds of steady greed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came from each stall, and sometimes stampings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whinnies (at well-known steps) and rampings<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Entered, as soon as he was able,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As boy at Caunter's racing stable;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, like the other boys, he slept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stall beside the horse he kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snug in the straw; and Caunter's stick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought morning to him all too quick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He learned the high quick gingery ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thoroughbreds; his stable days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made him a rider, groom and vet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He promised to be too thickset<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For jockeying, so left it soon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he was whip and rode Maroon.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He was a small, lean, wiry man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sunk cheeks weathered to a tan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarred by the spikes of hawthorn sprays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashed thro', head down, on going days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haste to see the line they took.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a beauty in his look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was intent. His speech was plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maroon's head, reaching to the rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had half his thought before he spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His "gone away," when foxes broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like a bell. His chief delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hunting fox from noon to night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pleasure lay in hounds and horses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved the Seven Springs water-courses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those flashing brooks (in good sound grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where scent would hang like breath on glass).<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He loved the English countryside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine-leaved bramble in the ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lichen on the apple-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poultry ranging on the lees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farms, the moist earth-smelling cover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife's green grave at Mitcheldover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where snowdrops pushed at the first thaw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under his hide his heart was raw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy and pity of these things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second whip was Kitty Myngs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still but a lad but keen and quick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Son of old Myngs who farmed the Wick),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horse-mouthed lad who knew his work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode the big black horse, the Turk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longed to be a huntsman bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had the horse-look, sharp and old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With much good-nature in his face.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His passion was to go the pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blood was crying for a taming.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was the Devil's chick for gaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a rare good lad to box.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sometimes had a main of cocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down at the Flags. His job with hounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At present kept his blood in bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rioting and running hare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tom Dansey made him have a care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He worshipped Dansey heart and soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a huntsman was his goal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be with hounds, to charge full tilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blackthorns that made the gentry wilt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his ambition and his hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a hot colt needing rope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was too quick to speak his passion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To suit his present huntsman's fashion.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The loitering water, flooded full,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
